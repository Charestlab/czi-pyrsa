The development of the Python representational similarity analysis toolbox emerged from the cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience community and is now used by scientists from multiple disciplines. The communities that use RSA tools include cognitive and computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence applied to multiple models in biosciences (for e.g. a recent manuscript used representational similarity analysis with deep learning of terrain morphology in deep-sea mineral exploration). By delivering well documented, streamlined pipelines for creating RDMs and comparing them between measurement modalities and computational models, and performing statistical inference to establish which model best describes the measurements’ representational signatures, the tools that we the community is developing in pyRSA promise to bridge the gap between scientific communities. Our distance metrics and RDM comparison tools rely on linear algebra supported by numpy’s einstein summation convention, which is also included in artificial intelligence packages including tensorflow and pytorch. In a future release of pyRSA, we plan to further support representational similarity analysis on the GPU. This not only allows a common framework that is used by multiple disciplines, but improves computational performance, when available, and allows costly bootstrap resampling procedures or permutation tests for statistical inference over large datasets in a reasonable and manageable timeline for research projects.

The last decade has seen the development of state-of-the-art computer algorithms, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), that can learn specific representations [10] and match human performance on certain tasks [11]. These models are inspired by brains, and the use of ANNs to try and better understand human brain function is rapidly growing. Indeed, cognitive computational neuroscience (CCN) is an emerging field in the study of brain function, the aim of which is to close the gap between the fields of cognitive psychology, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence [12,13]. While such multidisciplinary integration is exciting, in practice it is difficult because a single research team often lacks expertise in all three fields. The versatility of RSA, which can provide representational signatures that can be compared between models, brains, behaviour, can alleviate this difficulty, and be fully exploited by the different scientific communities through our open-source, python toolbox for RSA.
