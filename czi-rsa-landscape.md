Our development of an open-source toolbox for representational similarity analysis began a decade ago with the development of the MATLAB rsatoolbox (https://github.com/rsagroup/rsatoolbox/). This toolbox is the most widely used toolbox for representational similarity analysis in medical imaging. Other toolboxes that offer tools to perform RSA are: The Decoding Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/tdtdecodingtoolbox/),  CoSMoMVPA (http://www.cosmomvpa.org/), 

With the desire to increase accessibility and openness, we started the development of the next version of the rsatoolbox in Python. 

RSA has a strong user base in multiple scientific disciplines (e.g. see https://github.com/Charestlab/czi-pyrsa/blob/main/czi-rsa-landmark.png).
